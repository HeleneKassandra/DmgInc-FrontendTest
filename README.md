# DI Frontend Assignment
This application is a basic react application created with Create React App.
It'll offer you the basic you need to complete the assignment. 

You decide how many components you think it's needed, and 
the structure you prefer. This is simply a boilerplate, making it so you dont have to setup 
the project yourself

You're free to choose what packages you include, but let us know which ones you've used. 

## Getting started
To get started on the assignment, fork this repository.
When forked, you have to clone the forked version down to your computer like you would any other repo.

Once repo is cloned, you can open it in an editor, and run `npm install`
to install all dependencies. 

After that you should be able to run `npm run start` 
to run it locally. 

## Delivering

Once you're done with the assginment, make sure everything is pushed.
Then send a direct link to repo, through the DI site.
